This is a simple Hangman game written in Python as part of the 100 Days of Python course. The game allows players to guess the letters of a hidden word, with limited incorrect attempts before the game ends.
The code performs the following:
1. Allows the user to guess letters one by one.
2. Tracks wrong guesses and limits the number of attempts.
3. ASCII art visuals to represent the hangmanâ€™s progress.
